Please note it is my first java app so code is most likely not to up to high standard.

Barebone base version for my application to Read & modify DXF Files that I made for my work.

This is only base version as I cannot share full version due to confidential data.

It is not catch-all solution, it was created based only on 2D drawings.

I have included some example classes how you can use it to read or modify elements in your CAD files.

Simple documentation included in com.Matthas.main folder.
